## George Hagstrom

* I based my vignette on the [EPA AQS API](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html)
* I used httr2 to download the pm2.5 data from a single site located in New York County and then I plotted the data.
* Had I not been focused on sites, I could have more easily downloaded the data.
* I wonder what other APIs might have been available?
* This was a very fun project
