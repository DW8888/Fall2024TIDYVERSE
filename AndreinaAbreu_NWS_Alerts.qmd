# Title: NWS Weather Alerts Analysis
# Author: Andreina Abreu
# Description:

# API: Weather Alerts API by National Weather Service (NWS)
# API Documentation: https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/alerts_query

# Introduction:
# The Weather Alerts API provides access to real-time weather alerts across the U.S. 
# In this analysis, I retrieve current severe weather alerts and determine the most frequently reported event types.

# Code:
# Load necessary packages
library(httr2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(purrr)  

# Define API URL
url <- "https://api.weather.gov/alerts"

# Function to get weather alerts
get_weather_alerts <- function() {
  response <- request(url) %>%
    req_perform()
  
  if (response$status_code == 200) {
    return(resp_body_json(response)$features)  
  } else {
    stop("Error: ", response$status_code)
  }
}

# Process data into tidy format
alerts_data <- get_weather_alerts()

alerts_df <- tibble(
  event = map_chr(alerts_data, ~ .x$properties$event %||% "Unknown"),
  severity = map_chr(alerts_data, ~ .x$properties$severity %||% "Unknown"),
  urgency = map_chr(alerts_data, ~ .x$properties$urgency %||% "Unknown"),
  area_desc = map_chr(alerts_data, ~ .x$properties$areaDesc %||% "Unknown"),
  headline = map_chr(alerts_data, ~ .x$properties$headline %||% "No Headline")
)

# Count occurrences of each event type
event_counts <- alerts_df %>%
  group_by(event) %>%
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop') %>%
  arrange(desc(count))

print(event_counts)

# Visualization
ggplot(event_counts, aes(x = reorder(event, count), y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "pink") +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Severe Weather Events",
       x = "Event Type",
       y = "Number of Alerts") +
  theme_minimal()

# Conclusion:
# The analysis reveals that Severe Thunderstorm Warnings are the most frequent alerts, indicating a significant risk
# and the need for awareness around these events. Other frequent alerts, such as Small Craft Advisories and 
# Gale Warnings, also show notable weather risks for specific regions.
